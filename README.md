# Isaac Cheah
Hi! Listed below are some of my personal projects.<br>
I code mainly in Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
Looking to gain some experience in software projects related to healthcare.<br>

My main project at the moment is an exam simulator which utilises AI to enhance and aid the test-taker's simulation experience.<br>

Feel free to reach me at <isaaccheah@outlook.com>!
